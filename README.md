## ðŸ‘¤ Get to Know Me Better
My passions are what motivate me in life and get me out of the bed in the morning. Some of these passions are family, friends, technology, basketball, and many more. I will start with technology. I have always been a problem solver - whether it be solving puzzles, doing math, fixing my basketball jumpshot. In high school, I learned how I could utilize technology (coding) to solve problems. That is what attracted me to Informatics, as it is just that: solving problems with technology. With a concentration in Business, I have learned how my array of technical skills can be used to help businesses drive decision making and build effective applications for stakeholders. The main idea that separates me from others is simple: I **LOVE** what I learn. I truly enjoy and find purpose in finding solutions with technolog as it is like solving a puzzle to me, which I can't get enough of. I am looking for an opportunity to grow, foster, and highlight my skillset and learn more about the real-world and how I can make an impact!
